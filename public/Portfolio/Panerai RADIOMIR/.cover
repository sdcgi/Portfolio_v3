# Name an image file to use as a cover below (with its file extension).
# The site will scan for the named file in this, or child directories until it finds it.
# If no file is listed below, it will use the 1st image it finds in the directory.
# So you can just put a single image in the directory to sutomatically use as a cover
# and it will be hidden in the grid whern you click through.
